Dear Chin and Stella, 

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss our thinking on discrete event simulation -- with emphasis on R for the applied examples. 

Would you please circulate this email to the participants before the session?  

If you want to follow the exercises in real time, 
	•	You need R (>=4.0.0), preferably with an IDE such as R Studio.
	•	Install packages data.table and nhppp (>=1.0.0). To install them from CRAN,
	◦	> install.packages("data.table")
	◦	> install.packages("nhppp")


Starting on the morning of 16/12/2024, all materials will be accessible 
	•	through this Dropbox link (full link in the PS) through 17/01/2025. Password "columbia_2024", without the quotation marks. 
	•	at https://github.com/ttrikalin/des-R-course (download the 2024_columbia release)

Thanks once more for hosting me -- and looking forward to meeting you all.

This is joint work with Fernando Alarid-Escudero at Stanford and Yuliia Sereda and Stavroula Chrysanthopoulou at Brown. 

Regards 

Tom
